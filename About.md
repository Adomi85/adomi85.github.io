## About Me

I’m Tomi, a software development student who enjoys solving problems and building things with code. I’m into software development in general, but lately I’ve been especially interested in creating applications using JavaScript, React, Node.js, and sometimes C# when the project calls for it.

I’ve always had an interest in technology—figuring out how things work and tackling problems one step at a time. That curiosity has turned into something practical, and each project helps me improve my skills and stay sharp as I keep growing in the field.

What draws me in most are the “aha” moments—the thrill of untangling a stubborn issue, and knowing a fix might actually make someone's life a little easier. I don’t aim to know everything (no one really can), but I do know how to dig deep, ask questions, and build thoughtful solutions.

I’m still early in my journey, but I’m drawn to work that makes a difference—tools that help, systems that simplify, and teams that share the wins and the challenges. What you’ll find here is the story so far—from the skills I’ve built to the steps I’ve taken in my career.
