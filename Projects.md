#### ðŸ”¥ Boiler Heating System

- **Tech:** React, Node.js, Express, Cron, SQLite, CORS
- **Overview:** A smart heating control system that schedules boiler usage based on current electricity prices and local weather conditionsâ€”designed to optimize energy consumption and cut costs intelligently.
- **Why We Built It:** Created as part of a school project, this app was developed by our team to tackle a practical real-world challenge using real-time data and thoughtful design.
- **My Role:** I served as Scrum Master, helping guide our process and communication, while also contributing to the development sideâ€”structuring and implementing the SQLite database behind the appâ€™s functionality.
- **Lessons Learned:** Stepping into the Scrum Master role taught me a lot about patience and self-awareness. It wasnâ€™t always easy to stay hands-off with the code, but I learned to trust the team and focus on steering our workflow. When needed, I supported the dev side, but the bigger win was embracing Agile principles and diving deeper into DevOps practices that made our process smoother.
