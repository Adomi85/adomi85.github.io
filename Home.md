# Hey, I'm Tomi

I'm a software development student at Karelia University of Applied Sciences, where I've assembled a toolkit of languages, logic, and late-night debugging stamina. I write code, break it, fix it, and occasionally celebrate when it behaves. I'm drawn to building things that make life a little simpler. Think of this page as the current version of me -- code, projects, and a developer in progress.
